**3. **Enemy Activity:**
The *Black Pearl* has been confirmed to be in these waters. The infamous pirate vessel has eluded capture thus far, owing to the crew’s superior knowledge of the tides and unorthodox tactics. The ship was last sighted near Tortuga, following a raid on a merchant convoy.

Additionally, reports have surfaced regarding the *Flying Dutchman* under the command of Captain Davy Jones. The cursed vessel has been engaging merchant ships near the Gulf of Mexico. We are still gathering intelligence regarding its movements.

**4. **Engagement Report:**
- **Skirmish with the *Black Pearl***:  
On the evening of the 20th, we engaged the *Black Pearl* under the cover of nightfall. Despite initial successes in pursuit, the *Pearl* utilized its superior speed and the fog to escape. Our crew did not sustain casualties, but we did suffer damage to the foremast during a brief exchange of cannon fire. The *Pearl* is a formidable adversary, and Captain Jack Sparrow’s tactics continue to frustrate our efforts.

- **Encounter with the *Sea Serpent***:  
On the 23rd, a confrontation with a pirate ship, known as *The Sea Serpent*, occurred near the island of Hispaniola. The pirates, led by the notorious Captain Scarlett Vane, engaged in a standard attack on our convoy. We successfully repelled their assault, sinking two vessels and forcing Captain Vane to retreat under the cover of night. We estimate the loss of 30 pirates and the capture of three survivors, now detained aboard the *Dauntless*.

- **Privateer Action**:  
The *Triton* intercepted a group of privateers operating under the guise of a merchant vessel. They attempted to board and seize a Royal Navy merchant fleet, but the crew of the *Triton* swiftly neutralized the threat. One of the privateers, upon being interrogated, claimed to have been in contact with a “shadowy figure” believed to be Captain Teague, father of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow.

**5. **Casualties:**
- **Royal Navy**: No fatalities reported. One wounded seaman from the *Dauntless* during the skirmish with the *Sea Serpent*. He is expected to make a full recovery.
- **Pirates/Privateers**: Approx. 40 confirmed dead, with an additional 12 prisoners in custody.

---

**6. **Action Items/Recommendations:**
- **Continued Pursuit of *Black Pearl***: Given the elusive nature of the *Black Pearl*, I recommend a heightened watch and a new strategy for pursuit, including the use of smaller, faster ships for covert operations. We must also consider the possibility that Sparrow’s crew may possess knowledge of the sea that we do not.
- **Investigation of Cursed Artifacts**: A report was received from a civilian ship regarding a possible sighting of cursed gold recovered from the wreck of the *Wicked Wench*. I advise sending a team to investigate further, as such artifacts could hold significant strategic value or pose a threat.
- **Enhanced Patrols for *Flying Dutchman***: The *Flying Dutchman* continues to strike fear into the heart of the fleet. Increased patrols are necessary in the Gulf of Mexico, and a fleet-wide alert should be issued regarding the ship's supernatural nature.

---

**7. **Conclusion:**
The seas remain perilous as pirates continue to threaten trade routes and the Crown’s authority. The *Dauntless* and its allied ships will remain vigilant and prepared to engage all enemies of the Crown. The battle for control of the Caribbean is far from over, but with steady leadership and unwavering courage, we shall secure victory.
