### **British Navy – HMS *Revenge***  
**Captain:** **Captain Edward "Ironfist" Harding**  
- A stern and unyielding officer, renowned for his discipline and ruthless pursuit of pirates. Harding's reputation precedes him, and his ironclad rule aboard the *Revenge* ensures that no pirate is safe from his wrath. His rigid adherence to protocol hides a mind that is as sharp as a cutlass, always planning two steps ahead.

---

#### **First Lieutenant:** **Lieutenant Samuel "Sammy" Greaves**  
- A clever and ambitious officer, Greaves is Harding's right hand. He lacks the true discipline of his captain but makes up for it with a sharp wit and an even sharper sword. Greaves harbors a secret desire to one day take the captain's chair, though he remains loyal—for now.

---

#### **Second Lieutenant:** **Lieutenant Felicity "Flick" Rowe**  
- A rare female officer in the British Navy, Flick commands respect with her no-nonsense attitude and her uncanny ability to read people. Her reputation is that of a quick thinker and a ruthless strategist. She’s got a soft spot for underdogs, though—especially when they prove themselves.

---

#### **Master Gunner:** **Gunner Tobias "The Bull" Sutherland**  
- Known for his fiery temper and explosive personality, Bull Sutherland can aim and fire the *Revenge’s* cannons with deadly precision. His love for gunpowder and the thrill of battle is matched only by his distaste for diplomacy. He’s always the first to call for a broadside, regardless of the consequences.

---

#### **Ship’s Surgeon:** **Dr. Cedric Foulke**  
- A man with a dark, twisted sense of humor, Foulke is both a skilled doctor and a bit of a madman. Rumors say he’s more interested in experimenting with his patients than actually healing them. His bedside manner is atrocious, and his scalpel is often more dangerous than the wounds themselves.

---

#### **Quartermaster:** **Thomas "Tommy" Blackwood**  
- Blackwood’s loyalty to the crown is absolute, but he harbors a deep, personal grudge against pirates—his brother was once lost to their treachery. He’s known for his meticulous record-keeping, overseeing the distribution of supplies and keeping a sharp eye on inventory. His talent for diplomacy is notable, though often tempered by his brooding demeanor.

---

#### **Boatswain:** **Isaac "Slick" Turner**  
- Slick is a man of quick hands and even quicker words. He’s responsible for overseeing the ship’s rigging and ensuring that the *Revenge* is always ready for combat or pursuit. His charm is only matched by his deceit, and his loyalties are always up for negotiation—he’s been known to "borrow" supplies for a hefty price.

---

#### **Navigator:** **William "Willy" Hale**  
- With a penchant for maps and a remarkable memory for the stars, Hale is the *Revenge’s* navigator. He’s seen more than his fair share of pirate-infested waters and has lived to tell the tale—though he often exaggerates the danger. His fondness for rum leads to a slightly unreliable sense of direction, but he’s still the best they have.

---

#### **Ship’s Carpenter:** **Liam "Stitch" O’Reilly**  
- O’Reilly is a man who can repair anything, from shattered hulls to broken spirits. A former pirate who was captured in a raid, Stitch now serves the crown with an iron fist. His loyalties remain somewhat questionable, as his old pirate comrades occasionally "visit" him in the dead of night.

---

#### **Cook:** **Bartholomew "Barty" Jenkins**  
- A gruff but jolly fellow, Barty is the heart of the *Revenge* in more ways than one. The crew is always certain of two things: the food will be filling, and it will likely be covered in a thick layer of salt. Barty may not be the most skilled chef, but he’s great at keeping the crew’s morale up—especially when rum is involved.

---

#### **Midshipman:** **Oliver "Ollie" Hart**  
- A young, ambitious officer, Ollie is eager to prove himself in the Navy. He joined the *Revenge* as a midshipman to escape the poverty of London. His youthful exuberance often gets him into trouble, but his earnestness and determination have made him a favorite among the crew—though they’d never admit it.

---

#### **Deckhand:** **Jack "Jolly" Hawkins**  
- A seasoned sailor with a laugh that can be heard across the ship, Jolly Hawkins is a man who knows how to make the best of a bad situation. His carefree attitude makes him popular among the crew, though it often causes tension with the more disciplined officers. He is always ready with a song or a joke to lighten the mood during long voyages.

---

#### **Lookout:** **Riley "Razor" Finch**  
- With eyes sharper than a hawk’s, Razor Finch stands tall in the crow’s nest, constantly scanning the horizon for threats or opportunities. He’s known for spotting danger long before it arrives, making him one of the Navy’s most valuable assets. His silence is only broken by his booming voice when danger approaches.

---

#### **Cannoneer:** **Hector "Flint" Murdock**  
- Flint is as calm as the eye of a storm and just as deadly. A master of the ship’s cannons, he is responsible for the devastating volleys that can turn the tide of battle. His silent demeanor hides a fierce passion for the Navy and a deep desire to make his mark in history, though he has a dark secret about his past.

---

### **End of Roster**  
Each man and woman aboard the *HMS Revenge* serves with pride and determination. They are the British Navy’s finest, bound by duty to the crown and a promise to rid the seas of those who dare oppose them. But even in the King's service, the ocean’s mysteries are never far, and the call of adventure is never truly silenced.
