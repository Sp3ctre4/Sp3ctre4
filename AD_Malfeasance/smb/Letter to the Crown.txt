**Captain Jack Sparrow's Letter to the Royal Crown**

To the Most Honorable and Unsurpassably Magnificent Royal Crown of the Grand Empire,

Ahoy, your majesties, and any ill-fated bureaucrats who happen to be reading this on behalf of the crown—yes, you. I see you there, with your monocles and impeccable waistcoats. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Captain Jack Sparrow, scourge of the seven seas, self-proclaimed master of fortune, and (as some would call it) *the* most endearing pirate who ever graced your shores with his incomparable swagger and whimsical disregard for authority.

Now, I come to you in this most civil and proper fashion, as any gentleman would, to address a few matters of utmost importance. You see, there appears to be some, let’s call it *confusion*, regarding my most recent ventures across the Atlantic and, indeed, my romantic entanglements with your fine vessels. Some say I "stole" from you, which is utterly ridiculous. It’s more accurate to say I “reappropriated” certain… *items* of a highly valuable and quite spectacular nature, and that was *only* after I made sure to ensure their *well-being*. The truth is, I saved you from your own poor taste in ships, treasure, and, quite frankly, your *entire fleet*.

To address one particularly troublesome incident in which I allegedly “commandeered” your *most prized* ship, the *Royal Sovereign* (I believe it was named such, yes?), I must point out that it was simply an oversight on your part. Why would you allow such a grand vessel to remain unguarded on the open seas? It was *clearly* a cry for help, and I answered, as any honorable pirate would, by taking it upon myself to “escort” the vessel to safer waters. Naturally, I did not anticipate the additional, somewhat excessive *musket fire* from your crew, but what can one do?

Regarding the bounty you’ve placed on my head (which, I assure you, is quite flattering), I believe it was a bit of an overreaction. Surely, a man of my... *gifts* deserves a bit more respect than being hunted like some common alley rat. If you want, I’d be more than happy to negotiate a *substantial* reduction in the reward, perhaps by offering you my finest bottle of rum, or a truly delightful new navigational technique I’ve developed, involving neither maps nor compasses. It's far more accurate, I assure you.

On that note, there seems to be some pressing issue with the *rum supply* in your royal establishments, and I must *personally* investigate this matter. It's been brought to my attention that certain “regulations” have made their way into your beloved taverns—rules about serving sizes, temperatures, and *absolutely no* rum cocktails before noon. Preposterous! I shall make it my mission to ensure your fine crown has access to a far more *liberated* drinking policy, one free of needless restrictions and entirely supported by pirate law.

In closing, I suggest you take a moment to reconsider your rather aggressive stance toward me. In truth, I am an asset to your empire, if only you would stop looking at my methods as problematic and instead acknowledge them as… *creative solutions to maritime challenges*. I do hope you’ll consider this letter with the grace and wisdom it was written with (after several pints of rum, naturally), and let’s settle our little misunderstanding over a friendly game of dice or, perhaps, a *bit of treasure hunting*.

If you’d like to respond, I suggest you do so quickly, as I am currently en route to your treasury. Not to steal anything, of course. Merely *exploring*. It's all in the spirit of *research*.

Yours (begrudgingly) in the pursuit of glory, rum, and the occasional cursed artifact,

**Captain Jack Sparrow**  
The One and Only, Pirate Extraordinaire  
Master of the Black Pearl  
Friend of the Sea, Nemesis of Your Fleet
