**Lieutenant Green,**

I trust this letter finds you in good health and high spirits despite the perilous nature of our endeavors in these treacherous waters.

It has come to the attention of His Majesty’s Admiralty that the pirate menace is not only growing bolder but also more cunning with each passing week. The *Black Pearl*—that accursed vessel under the command of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow—has once again evaded capture, this time by using the cover of a fierce tropical storm. I need not remind you, Lieutenant, of the dangers we face when engaging such a vessel, for Sparrow’s knowledge of the sea, coupled with his propensity for misdirection, makes him an adversary unlike any we have encountered.

Your recent engagement with the *Sea Serpent*, while admirable in its execution, was but a minor victory in what seems to be an endless war at sea. Captain Scarlett Vane’s vessel was indeed repelled, but reports suggest that she is not the only pirate leader rallying in the Gulf of Mexico. We believe that Vane, along with several other pirate lords, is now under the sway of a more sinister force—a shadowy figure who is rumored to be in league with the crew of the *Flying Dutchman*. You are instructed to keep this information under strict confidence for the time being, as the implications are as dire as they are unsettling.

In light of these developments, your orders are as follows:

1. **Heightened Vigilance**: Double the number of patrols around the waters off Tortuga and the Windward Passage. Should the *Black Pearl* or any other pirate ship be sighted, engage with full force. However, exercise extreme caution when dealing with Sparrow—his crew has been known to employ unorthodox tactics, and rumors of supernatural elements aboard his ship have reached our ears. 

2. **Investigate the *Flying Dutchman***: Reliable sources report sightings of the cursed vessel near the coast of Hispaniola. Its captain, the notorious Davy Jones, is said to have made a pact with the darkest of forces. If the *Dutchman* is indeed in these waters, it represents a far greater threat than any pirate we’ve faced. Immediate reconnaissance is required.

3. **Recovery of the *Dead Man's Chest***: Intelligence suggests that the *Dead Man's Chest*—which is said to contain the heart of Davy Jones himself—has resurfaced. The chest may hold the key to understanding the forces behind the *Flying Dutchman* and its cursed crew. I trust you will pursue this lead with all due diligence, though be wary of any attempts to deceive you regarding its location. Pirates are known to lie, and the cursed objects of legend hold far more power than is often acknowledged.

4. **Report to Port Royal**: Should any new developments arise, or should your ship require assistance in engagement, return to Port Royal with all haste. The Admiralty is prepared to offer reinforcements or supplies as needed, and your safety is of the utmost concern. 

We trust in your capable leadership, Lieutenant, and know that your crew is equal to the challenges that lie ahead. May the winds favor your sails and the ocean's fury remain in check—though I fear that our enemies are far more dangerous than the tempest itself.

**God save the King and the Fleet.**

**Yours in service,**
