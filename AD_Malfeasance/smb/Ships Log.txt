### **SHIP'S LOG**  
**The Black Pearl**  
**Captain: Jack Sparrow**  
**Date: 26th of February, 1725**

**Wind:** Favorable, though fickle. One moment the sea be calm, the next, a storm brews from the depths.

**Sea State:** Restless, like a beast gnashing at the chains of its cage. The water churns darkly beneath the Pearl's hull, as if the ocean herself be planning a mutiny.

**Crew:** Spirits high, despite the odd rum ration being less than expected. Several men have been heard muttering about a *cursed* coin that has gone missing, or so they claim. I suspect it’s merely a matter of superstition, but the lads seem determined to believe.

**Captain's Log:**  
A fine day for pirating! We encountered a merchant vessel drifting near the edge of the Devil's Triangle. A mighty prize! The crew was eager, ready to board, but I took my sweet time. Let them sweat. Never give a ship the satisfaction of knowing it’s about to meet its doom. As expected, the fools put up no fight. Their goods were loaded with fine silks and rare spices, but no gold. Always a disappointment when the gold is lacking.

**A curious thing occurred during the skirmish**—a strange figure appeared on the horizon, just beyond the mist. Tall and dark, almost spectral. I ordered the crew to stand down, but as quickly as they came, they vanished. Some say it was a ghost ship, others believe it to be a trick of the light, but I know better. There’s more to this sea than meets the eye, and I have a feeling that what we saw today is connected to that blasted *Black Spot*.

We’ve crossed into dangerous waters, the crew murmurs about dark powers stirring beneath the waves. But they are wrong; the *Black Pearl* is indomitable. We sail not only to survive, but to claim what is rightfully ours!

**The night’s work:** The treasure chest is heavy with trinkets, but the real treasure is the map. The one that points to the Isle of the Dead Man’s Chest. There’s talk of Davy Jones, but I wouldn’t put much stock in it. Still, I’d be lying if I said it didn’t send a shiver down my spine. 

**First Mate's Report:** Gibbs insists we head to Tortuga for repairs, though I suspect he’s merely looking for more rum. The man has a nose for the stuff like a dog has for bones.

**A Message for the Sea:** I, Jack Sparrow, captain of the *Black Pearl*, claim dominion over the waters we sail, and to the depths that lie beneath. There is no other pirate like me. The sea may rise, the storm may rage, but *I* shall always find my way. Always.

**Captain Jack Sparrow's final note:** To anyone who dares cross me—beware. If you think you’ve outsmarted me, you’ve made a grave mistake. And if you think you’ve escaped with your life... then you clearly don’t know who I am.
