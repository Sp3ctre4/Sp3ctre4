# AD Malfeasance!

A repository to house some scripts to automate the creation of a vulnerable AD environment for the pleasure of breaking everything (safely of course).

## Instructions

 - Configure ansible for the local user: `./config-ansible.sh`
 - Run the playbook: `ansible-playbook -i pirate-inventory.yml pirate-playbook.yml`

If it doesn't work... cry
